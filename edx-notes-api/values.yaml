# Default values for notes helm chart
# Declare variables to be passed into your templates.

# Defaults should generally be as close to production ready as possible, but should not include things like default passwords etc.
# edx.org uses managed backend services for mysql and elasticsearch, but we default them to 'on' here so that the application is as close to runnable as possible.
# Use at your own risk.

# If you add something like a new password, it should be set as required in templates/secrets.yaml, and left blank so that users that
# forget to specify it will be prompted to fill it out.

  # this is done so we can use the secret from our values.yaml since mysql and

  # This is a common practice in the helm stable charts
