New version of k8s-cli-util

Moved autoscaler api endpoints to use apps/v1 instead of apps/v1beta1, requires K8s > 1.10, but should

Ingresses now have a generated number after them to prevent names colliding

0.3.2
Added parameter to allow the customization of the healthcheck endpoint with
/health as the default value.
health_check.endpoint: "/health"

0.3.1
Added ability to override the app.port, default is backwards compatible
        app.port: 18170

0.3.0
Change defaults for the following variables as it was discovered
that the apps are mostly consistent, it is vault that is inconsistent.
        app.migrations.migrate_db_user_env_name: DB_MIGRATION_USER
        app.migrations.migrate_db_pass_env_name: DB_MIGRATION_PASS

0.2.2
Fix secret render indentation to fit configmap

0.2.1
Render config as Yaml instead of as a serialized map

v0.2.0
Added the following values to allow user to overwrite migration env names,
since they differ between applications.  The following defaults were assigned:

        app.migrations.migrate_db_user_env_name: DATABASE_MIGRATE_USER
        app.migrations.migrate_db_pass_env_name: DATABASE_MIGRATE_PASSWORD

This is a breaking change since the default migrate_db_pass_env_name was
previously: DB_MIGRATION_PASS

v0.1.1
Fixed bug where image:tag pairings were not valid

v0.1.0
Added overridable issuer for ingresses for the cert issuer.
You will need to add an 'issuer' to each ingress using this version.
