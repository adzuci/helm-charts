0.2.1
Render config as Yaml instead of as a serialized map

v0.2.0
Added the following values to allow user to overwrite migration env names,
since they differ between applications.  The following defaults were assigned:

        app.migrations.migrate_db_user_env_name: DATABASE_MIGRATE_USER
        app.migrations.migrate_db_pass_env_name: DATABASE_MIGRATE_PASSWORD

This is a breaking change since the default migrate_db_pass_env_name was
previously: DB_MIGRATION_PASS

v0.1.1
Fixed bug where image:tag pairings were not valid

v0.1.0
Added overridable issuer for ingresses for the cert issuer.
You will need to add an 'issuer' to each ingress using this version.

v0.0.4
Fix bug that resulted in an impossible autoscaling configuration min > max

v0.0.3
Allow applications to not specify a role_arn. Removed fake role ARN from service accounts by default.

v0.0.2
Added support for arbitrary application environment variables that get passed into all containers running the application image
to support applications that have non standard ENV setups.  

v0.0.1
